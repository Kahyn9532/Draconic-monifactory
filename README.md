<h1 align="center">Draconic Monifactory</h1>
Draconic monifactory is a group of kubejs scripts for the draconic evolution mod to integrate with Monifactory


This projects scripts are heavily forked from monifactory's


These scripts will feature a changement in the recipes of most draconic evolution items making them more difficult to achieve.(and more greggy ;) )

## Installation:
1st step: Download the kubejs file, duh

2nd step: Copy it

3rd step: Paste it in the monifactory folder

4th step: Click on "Replace the files in the destination"

## Misc:
I might make it an official optional compat when the project will be entirely finished.


Don't hesitate to open a new issue if there is one or to make a suggestion for the project.

I'd also like to say that this project WILL take a lot of time to be finished as i'm making it
parellel to studying and also because i'm new around coding.
