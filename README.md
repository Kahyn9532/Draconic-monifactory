# Draconic-monifactory
Draconic monifactory is a group of kubejs scripts for the draconic evolution mod to integrate with Monifactory

THIS PROJECT IS IN A EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE
The idea is just to download the js files, and add them to their respective directories.
This projects scripts are heavily forked from monifactory's


This add-on will feature a changement in the craft of most items making them way more difficult to achive.(reffering to ae2 automation)
Currently fusion crafting have been replaced with assembly line recipes.
If there is a way to add custom fusion crafting with kubejs I will work on it the fastest I can.
I plan on making it an official optional compat when the project will be entirely finished.


Don't hesitate to open a new issue if there is one or to make a suggestion for the project.
I'd also like to say that this project WILL take more time to be finished as i'm making it
parellel to studying and also because i'm new around coding.

Tiny roadmap :

-Basic craft changes: Done
-Total recipe change: 30% done
-Integration with quests: Not done
-Added as an optional compat: Not done
