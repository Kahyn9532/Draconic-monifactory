# Draconic-monifactory
Draconic monifactory is a group of kubejs scripts for the draconic evolution mod to integrate with Monifactory


The idea is just to download the js files, and add them to their respective directories.

This projects scripts are heavily forked from monifactory's


These scripts will feature a changement in the recipes of most draconic evolution items making them more difficult to achieve.(and more greggy ;) )

I might make it an official optional compat when the project will be entirely finished.


Don't hesitate to open a new issue if there is one or to make a suggestion for the project.

I'd also like to say that this project WILL take more time to be finished as i'm making it
parellel to studying and also because i'm new around coding.
